* file-regex
  #+BEGIN_SRC text
  USAGE:
    file-regex <pattern> <path>
  #+END_SRC
  This simple application takes two arguments --- regular expression and path to a
  file. The application then returns zero (signifying success) when a regular
  expression matches the content of the file.  I implemented this tool in
  Rust, because Rust has support for matching bytes using regular expressions.
